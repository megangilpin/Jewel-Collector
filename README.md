Created jewel collector game with the help of jquery and bootstrap.

### Functionality Breakdown
At the start of each game the player will be shown a random number and each jewel button will have four hidden values assigned randomly. When the player clicks on a jewel button the random value assigned to the jewel button will be added to the players score.
